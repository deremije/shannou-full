                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Honeywell, as a giant group of disparate businesses, did not have a consistent
                        design language or style. Its brand was weakened by only having basic guidelines,
                        no clear foundational principles, and no styleguide for its many web presences and
                        software products.  
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        MY ROLE
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Over the course of a few years, I collaborated with different teams across different
                        businesses to create a set of guidelines and design assets for both the global and
                        digital brand and styleguides. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I created Control Library of reusable Sketch components which could be reused by designers
                        worldwide to efficiently use the DLS styles. I also collaborated with a team to create a greater
                        set of guidelines and design assets in Sketch and ensured that they closely follow the DLS.

                    <p>
                        As the lead for the icons and typography, I established and documented guidelines for those
                        categories. I also provided guidance and creative direction to ~20 designers in the international
                        studios on the use and creation of icons for their individual projects. I created and distributed icon
                        repositories for designers to increase consistency and efficiency.

                        With the goal of enabling consistency and consolidation of design frameworks, I worked closely
                        with development teams to create reusable patterns, templates and code snippets as well as a
                        web portal to house them and the brand and design guidelines. I played a core role in
                        leadership and design strategy to create a set of guidelines for desktop and mobile software,
                        web based apps and Marcom websites and examples of standard patterns and templates in
                        order to show how different modules fit into a cohesive whole.

                    <p>
                        I additionally worked to gain consensus across the diverse needs and goals of Honeywell’s
                        different businesses, Corporate, design and IT Teams to deliver a code library based on the new
                        design language, in order to increase speed and consistency within software and development.

                        I designed new patterns and components and guidelines for the DLS portal in order to
