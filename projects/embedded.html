                    THE PROBLEM
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Honeywell’s Aerospace business needed some fresh new approaches for the visual and interaction design of
                    their cabin management embedded and mobile apps called Ovation Select. Their apps provide passengers
                    and flight crew ways to communicate, to access audio and video entertainment systems and to control the
                    various parts of the cabin, such as the air, lights and window shades. They reached out to a handful of
                    designers around the world to redesign the app as part of a competition.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    MY ROLE
                </h3>
                <p>
                    As part of the 2 week design challenge, I redesigned the information architecture, and created three
                    interaction models for the new design as well as three visual design languages to see what would resonate
                    the most with its users. My design was chosen as a winning submission to be used by the Aerospace
                    business to deliver the next generation Ovation Select user interface.

                    Challenges with Screen Sizes
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Because the app needed to fit on a variety of screen sizes in order to be used in the seats, armrests and
                    cabin hallways, while still allowing access to most of the full functionality used on the larger screens, I
                    wanted to ensure that there would not be too much information on any screen at a time, so as to not
                    overwhelm the user. These boxes demonstrate the screen dimensions that we needed to accomodate:

                </h4>
                <p>
                    In order to simplify the existing UI and to improve usability, it was necessary to define the primary
                    functionality by breaking down common user needs into user task/activity flows. The individual activities
                    (such as listening to music, communicating with a flight attendant or seeing how much longer the flight
                    would be) could then be prioritized to optimize the information architecture. From this hiearchy, I was able
                    to simplify the top level screen by surfacing only the most commonly-used activities and to elevate those
                    global elements which needed to be easily accessible at all times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I created wireframes to demonstrate how the change from a hub-and-spoke model to a more common
                    mobile “drill-down and back” paradigm would simplify the UI and allow more focused activity flows

                    I created a few different style explorations based on the Honeywell Design Language before I arrived at the
                    final design.
