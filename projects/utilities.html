                        THE PROBLEM
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Utility companies around the world lose millions of dollars yearly to energy theft.
                        Field agents who are in charge of investigating and documenting the theft (so that it
                        can be stopped) have challenges around quickly getting evidential information for
                        many different sites and transmitting it back to the utilities. In many cases, they are
                        risking their safety and lives to do so. Because there are not many dedicated tools
                        specific for their jobs, they relied on a variety of methods with varying reliability and
                        efficacy. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although Honeywell had many established customers in the Utilities industry, their
                        user research revealed that there were additional customer needs for these Field
                        Agents which were not yet being by their current solutions, and so this uncovered a
                        business opportunity which could help address their specific needs.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        MY ROLE
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I conducted stakeholder interviews with utiliity experts in order to gather business
                        needs and to understand the workflows of the different work roles across their
                        customers. Using these findings, I created user flows, wireframes and final visual
                        designs which could be validated with customers before development started. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We mapped the high level user flows to understand the complexities of how different 
                        users' roles were interconnected.

                        To understand the full scope of the user experience and how the different user flows 
                        interacted, I created a logical screen flow and contextual state inventory.

                    <p>
                        After mapping out the main screen flows, I created a clickable prototype in Invision which could be
                        leveraged for user testing and also work as a reference for the development teams on how the app would
                        function.  I also created a series of protocol questions which could be taken into the field in order to validate
                        that the feature set we had created would address the Field Agents' needs and that it would fit their mental
                        models and diverse workflows.

                        In order to have a map style that would not detract from the interaction elements of the map, I designed a
                        neutral map style and worked with the development teams to get it implemented.
