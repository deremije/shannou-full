                        <p>
                            Honeywell's Lyric app was built as a stand-alone thermostat app. To create
                            extensbility to other devices, we had to design for it as a platform which would
                            accomodate the addition of other connected home devices. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Over the course of two years at Honeywell, I was the Design Lead for the Lyric app. I
                            worked with a small team of designers, both in-house and abroad to create the
                            interaction and visual design for the newest features of the Lyric app. I provided
                            creative direction, managed the design work and ensured the quality of the
                            production assets during that time. I additionally represented the team by working
                            closely with the engineers to ensure technical feasibility and that design intent was
                            understood.

                <p>
                    I established a design process to integrate with the developing adoption of agile methodologies and worked to ensure that
                    the essential step of design QA was included to ensure that what was developed matched the designs. I additionally worked
                    with external vendors in order to lead and support various projects for new products that were coming into the app.

                <p>
                    With the inclusion of the new T5 thermostat into the platform, it was crucial to ensure consistency between the thermostat
                    hardware embedded UI and the app experience. I worked with the hardware team and the Europe/Middle East/Asia teams
                    to create consistent patterns and guidelines around naming and icon usage in order to do this.

                    We created a scheduling model for its different automation capabilitiies and our team received three patents for the

                            Dell produced a few models of smart phones which they wanted to differentiate in
                            the market by offering features to complement and seamlessly integrate with those
                            which were already bundled on their desktop computers.

                            I was in charge of visual and production design to create apps and desktop widgets
                            for Dell's new line of Android phones. I additionally created a theme so that the look
                            and feel of the embedded OS would have consistency with the existing visual style.

                    I created a design for almost every part of the Android operating system in order to give it a
                    unique theme which would be consistent with the rest of the design language. I created visual
                    designs and custom launcher icons for the different desktop widgets which were embedded on
                    the devices. To ensure that my image assets and specs were implemented according to design, I
                    worked closely with the development teams.

                    While I can’t take credit for its eventual popularity, the Harmony One has since become one of the most
                    successful remote controls in the world, with over 2 million units shipped.

                        <p>
                            Utility companies around the world lose millions of dollars yearly to energy theft.
                            Field agents who are in charge of investigating and documenting the theft (so that it
                            can be stopped) have challenges around quickly getting evidential information for
                            many different sites and transmitting it back to the utilities. In many cases, they are
                            risking their safety and lives to do so. Because there are not many dedicated tools
                            specific for their jobs, they relied on a variety of methods with varying reliability and
                            efficacy.

                            Although Honeywell had many established customers in the Utilities industry, their
                            user research revealed that there were additional customer needs for these Field
                            Agents which were not yet being by their current solutions, and so this uncovered a
                            business opportunity which could help address their specific needs.

                            I conducted stakeholder interviews with utiliity experts in order to gather business
                            needs and to understand the workflows of the different work roles across their
                            customers. Using these findings, I created user flows, wireframes and final visual
                            designs which could be validated with customers before development started.

                            Honeywell, as a giant group of disparate businesses, did not have a consistent
                            design language or style. Its brand was weakened by only having basic guidelines,
                            no clear foundational principles, and no styleguide for its many web presences and
                            software products.

                        <p>
                            Over the course of a few years, I collaborated with different teams across different
                            businesses to create a set of guidelines and design assets for both the global and
                            digital brand and styleguides.

                    I created Control Library of reusable Sketch components which could be reused by designers
                    worldwide to efficiently use the DLS styles. I also collaborated with a team to create a greater
                    set of guidelines and design assets in Sketch and ensured that they closely follow the DLS.

                    As the lead for the icons and typography, I established and documented guidelines for those

                    With the goal of enabling consistency and consolidation of design frameworks, I worked closely
                    with development teams to create reusable patterns, templates and code snippets as well as a
                    web portal to house them and the brand and design guidelines. I played a core role in
                    leadership and design strategy to create a set of guidelines for desktop and mobile software,
                    web based apps and Marcom websites and examples of standard patterns and templates in
