                    THE PROBLEM
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Honeywell purchased a company which made desktop software for high-security contexts. They had
                    historically been a provider of integrated security solutions to government, commercial and critical
                    infrastructure customers throughout the world, but they wanted to expand their main product to other
                    verticals. In order to be competitive in the marketplace, the software needed a major facelift, both for the
                    outdated visual style and for modern interaction and usability improvements. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    MY ROLE
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I led a small team through the design process, from discovery and user research through interaction, visual
                    design, prototyping and hand-off to development. I provided creative direction to a junior designer and also
                    worked as an individual contributor.

                        <p>
                            After conducting a deep dive workshop with the
                            business, we learned about the productâ€™s current
                            functionality through product demos, interviews
                            with stakeholders and technical support and
                            delved into its intricacies by reading its technical
                            and training manuals. We uncovered
                            improvement quick wins by doing heuristic
                            analyses and competitive reviews on the product.

                        <p>
                            Having first learned about the users only by
                            talking with the business, we created a few
                            personas which we needed to validate by talking
                            to real people. We interviewed users at an
                            Airforce base who used the software in order to
                            fully understand the pain points of the product
                            and how it fit into their current workflows. We
                            performed contextual inquiries to uncover
                            hidden needs and opportunites for new solutions
                            that the product could provide.

                        <p>
                            We collaborated on brainstorming ways to
                            improve the product based on our findings. We
                            sketched interaction ideas in low fidelity and
                            iterated on them through rounds of guerilla
                            testing in order to see how understandable our
                            intial ideas were. Since the complicated legacy
                            product required days of training to use, our goal
                            was to simplify and make the UX straightforward
                            enough that people with no experience would
                            quickly pick up how it worked.

                            We updated the information architecture based
                            on the user's mental models and by the principal
                            tasks they needed to accomplish. We created
                            wireframes for some of the key user flows and
                            then we applied the evolving Connected Building
                            design language for the visual designs to them.
                            Then, we created prototypes with the mock-ups
                            to do usability testing with our principal users
                            and to get their feedback. We did a few rounds
                            of iterative design and testing to arrive at design
                            solutions which were well accepted and
                            understood.

                            During our research, we collected key findings
                            from each interview or contextual inquiry. We
                            put these onto sticky notes and created affinity
                            diagrams to make sense of the findings. We
                            documented the opportunities for product
                            features and solutions which could add value to
                            the customers and a list of key changes that
                            could be brought into the design and
                            development roadmap. We then prioritized these
                            in an opportunity matrix which plotted the
                            difficulty to implement against the user impact in

                            screens we designed. We provided design

                            prototypes and production specs through
                            Inspect. We worked with the engineers on the
                            team to ensure that our designs were feasible
                            and did design QA to make sure that they were
                            implemented correctly.
